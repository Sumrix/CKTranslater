  "I cannot believe it! The man I slept with was a servant of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s! When I awoke after our night together he had disappeared, leaving only an ominous message telling me who his real master is. Even worse, I think sleeping with him made me terribly sick.",
  "I cannot believe it! The woman I slept with was a servant of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s! When I awoke after our night together she had disappeared, leaving only an ominous message telling me who her real master is. Even worse, I think that sleeping with him made me terribly sick.",
  "That fiend!",
  "The plan worked exactly as I hoped. My envoy easily seduced [From.GetTitledFirstName], infecting [From.GetHerHim] with a terrible disease. Perhaps now [From.GetFirstName] will understand the error of [From.GetHerHis] ways.",
  "Justice is served.",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for being a slave to [From.GetHerHis] hunger. I am sure I can exploit [From.GetHerHis] gluttony to my advantage.",

The beast looks marvelous, and I cannot wait to have it cooked for my next dinner. If only it weren't for the message coming with it mockingly implying I would eat it all by myself...",
  "If that's the case, I will eat none of it!",
  "But I *will* eat it all myself!",
  "Perhaps I worded my message to [From.GetTitledFirstName] poorly. [From.GetSheHeCap] was angered by my gift for some reason and decided to refuse it.",
  "I will have to try something else...",
  "I probably shouldn't have eaten all the boar by myself. I am feeling horribly sick now, so much so that I can barely stand.",
  "This is all [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s fault!",
  "Just as expected, [From.GetTitledFirstName] could not resist gorging upon my gift. According to the latest rumors, [From.GetSheHe] now lays in [From.GetHerHis] bed, stricken by a grievous sickness.",
  "How predictable.",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [From.GetHerHis] greed. I am sure I can exploit [From.GetHerHis] love for money to my advantage in some way.",
  "A good old forgery will teach [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetHerHis] place.",
  "I have just received a golden scepter from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. According to the envoy who brought it to court, it is an old, priceless artifact which belonged to one of my ancestors and that [From.GetFirstName]'s scholars discovered recently at the borders of [From.GetHerHis] realm.",
  "This is too sacred a relic for me to flaunt it.",
  "What a marvelous addition to my crown jewels!",
  "It would appear [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s humility has gotten in the way of my plan. Word has it that [From.GetFirstName] has locked the forged artifact I gifted [From.GetHerHim] away from sight, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is unworthy of carrying it.",
  "Curses. I will have to try something else.",
  "I am beset by shame. The supposedly priceless artifact sent by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is nothing but a piece of wood painted in gold. What is worse is that the forgery was revealed just as I was explaining the history of the scepter to a foreign dignitary!",
  "Just as I hoped, [From.GetTitledFirstName] accepted my gift and could not resist flaunting it to [From.GetHerHis] friends and subjects. I have just received news that [From.GetSheHe] put [From.GetHerselfHimself] to shame in front of a foreign envoy a few days ago, when the forgery was revealed accidentally.",
  "How amusing.",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [From.GetHerHis] slothful, apathetic attitude. I am sure I can exploit [From.GetHerHis] distaste for all laborious tasks to my advantage in some way.",
  "Did [From.GetSheHe] surveyed [From.GetHerHis] borders recently?",
  "I have just received the most disturbing news. It has been brought to my attention that a recent survey of my lands has determined my demesne to be much smaller than I believed. All my Council members agree that I should verify the soundness of this report immediately if I do not wish to see the prestige of my realm be greatly diminished.",
  "Who cares? It is just a piece of scroll.",
  "This is going to be so much work!",
  "It appears that [From.GetTitledFirstName] did not care enough about the legitimacy of [From.GetHerHis] borders in order to fall from my falsified report. [From.GetHerHisCap] inconstant nature must be the cause of this blunder.",
  "I will have to try something different.",
  "All of this work was for nothing! As it turns out, the survey report was a false document planted by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] to undermine my authority as [Root.GetTitle].",
  "I am so tired...",
  "Just as I hoped, [From.GetTitledFirstName] spent a lot of time and resources only to discover that the report I provided [From.GetHerHim] with was false.",
  "At least [From.GetSheHe] did something for a change...",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [From.GetHerHis] short temper. I am sure I can exploit [From.GetHerHis] lack of patience to my advantage in some way.",
  "Is there not a parade in [From.GetHerHis] honor soon?",
  "The musky odor of mud fills my lungs as I stare in disbelief at my soiled clothes. The two urchins run away laughing, while my parade suddenly halts in the middle of the streets and my servants start surrounding me, asking me if I am hurt and hastily starting to clean me.",
  "It was but children...",
  "I will whip those dogs myself!",
  "My attempt to have [From.GetTitledFirstName] humiliate [From.GetHerselfHimself] did not succeed. According to reports, [From.GetSheHe] forgave the people I hired to disrupt [From.GetHerHis] parade without even trying to pursue them after their infraction.",
  "[From.GetHerHis] kind nature is to blame...",
  "I immediately run after the two little criminals, but they have already disappeared. In my rage, I spend hours wandering around [Root.Capital.GetName] in my pitiful state, yelling for the two scoundrels to come out. When I finally return to my [Root.GetHouse], a letter from [FromFrom.GetFirstName] awaits me, implying the [FromFrom.GetTitle]'s involvement in the entire affair.",
  "Why is [FromFrom.GetSheHe] tormenting me?",
  "Just as I hoped, [From.GetTitledFirstName] made a fool of [From.GetHerselfHimself], running around [From.Capital.GetName] smeared in mud to try and apprehend the people I hired to harass [From.GetHerHim].",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [From.GetHerHis] spiteful and opportunist nature. I am sure I can exploit [From.GetHerHis] insatiable envy to my advantage in some way.",
  "A fake claim, maybe?",
  "I have just received a wonderful gift from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetHerHisCap] Chancellor has recently discovered an old document legitimizing my claim on one of my neighbors' lands. [From.GetFirstName] has decided to offer it to me in a show of friendship.",
  "Thank you, but I do not need it.",
  "Just what I need!",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not interested in the false claim I provided [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] merely lacks the ambition to find my offer palatable.",
  "Unbelievable! I was just about to press my new claim, when several clear inconsistencies were discovered in [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s document. The claim [From.GetSheHe] gave me is fabricated, and, more importantly, very poorly fabricated! Hardly anybody will consider it valid if I decide to press it.",
  "This was all a waste of time!",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] was just about to start a war over my false claim before [From.GetSheHe] finally realized how useless the document I provided [From.GetHerHim] with was. Now [From.GetSheHe] is boiling in [From.GetHerHis] own bile, all [From.GetHerHis] dreams of a quick conquest squashed.",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] is notorious for [From.GetHerHis] pride. I am sure I can exploit [From.GetHerHis] vain obsession with [From.GetHerselfHimself] to my advantage in some way.",
  "Call for the court painter!",
  "An envoy from [From.Capital.GetName] has just delivered sumptuous portrait depicting me, as a gift from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The proportions and features are a bit off, but the quality of the piece is undeniable.",
  "The portrait is nice, but...",
  "It deserves to remain in plain sight.",
  "Unfortunately, although [From.GetTitledFirstName] accepted my gift, [From.GetHerHis] shy disposition prevented [From.GetHerHim] from putting the portrait on plain sight, where its true meaning would have been apparent.",
  "I will have to try something different...",
  "I cannot believe the pettiness of some people. The painting [FromFrom.GetFirstName] gave me lasted only a few days before starting to melt, twisting my features in a grotesque mockery of reality and filling the main hall with a foul stench. What is worse, many dignitaries saw it before I was informed of the problem and hastily ordered the rotting artwork to be removed.",
  "I have just received some hilarious news from [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s court. It appears the painting I gave [From.GetHerHim] has started to rot, both twisting the features of its subject into a ridiculous, grotesque mockery and filling [From.GetFirstName]'s palace with an unbearable stench.",
  "What an unexpected turn of events!",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] was sacrificed to the cruel [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] gods! Accounts describe how [From.GetSheHe] was forcefully dragged screaming on top of a temple and torn apart by mad priests.",
  "The priests drag [From.GetTitledFirstName] screaming to the top of the temple, they place [From.GetHerHim] on an altar, and slice [From.GetHerHim] open with a ceremonial dagger. They then tear out [From.GetHerHis] still beating heart to the cheers of the assembled crowd.",
  "Let this sacrifice appease you, almighty creators!",
  "You already have me!",
  "[From.GetSheHeCap] is so cute and fluffy, what would life even be like if I were to lose [From.GetHerHim]? I am not sure I could go on... I must do something about this and protect my beloved cat [From.GetBestName].",
  "[From.GetSheHeCap] must lap up some of my immortal blood for protection.",
  "Only I shall have this great power!",
  "[GetSocietyLeaderDesc]",
  "[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] swings [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetDuelWeapon] [other_combatant.GetClumsilyElegantly]. The fight has gone on forever, and my muscles are beginning to ache. With the remainder of my strength I [Root.GetKillingBlow].",
  "My opponent seems to be getting tired, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] moves becoming slower. Strengthened by the cheers of the crowd, I [Root.GetKillingBlow].",
  "I... yes, that was on purpose!",
  "Another victorious match.",
  "I am sorry it had to end this way.",
  "Your death was the only logical outcome, [other_combatant.GetSisterBrother].",
  "Just as I begin to think that I am wearing my opponent down, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] lunges at me, with more force than so far displayed.

  "Each blow of my weapon is becoming heavier, and I'm struggling to focus on my opponent, as the crowd cheers [other_combatant.GetHerHim] on. My vision is blurry when [other_combatant.GetSheHe] [other_combatant.GetKillingBlowOnMe].",
  "Still shivering, I cannot explain what happened. When it all came down to it, my legs gave way and I simply... I fled the duel! I am such a coward..! Why did I ever agree to this in the first place?",

  "I just wanted to prove that I am not afraid.",
  "It was too much, how they were just... All looking at me.",
  "[Root.GetFirstName], what is the MATTER with you?!",

  "It was all worth it.",
  "Just as I [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow], [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] manages to [Root.GetWeaponInjuringBlowOnMe]. Dizzy, I can just about make out the sounds of the crowd: it is not my name they are chanting.",
  "Where did I go wrong...?",
  "[other_combatant.GetTitledName] has already managed to [Root.GetWeaponInjuringBlowOnMe], when something twisted passes over [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face.

I try to ask why, but no words come out.",
  "[other_combatant.GetTitledName] has already managed to [Root.GetWeaponInjuringBlowOnMe], when [other_combatant.GetSheHe] lets out an angry grunt.

I've waited to hear from [From.GetFirstName] for what feels like ages, and every letter I receive in its stead feels like mockery. \"What's this seal?\" I mumble, suddenly curious. Soon, relief is washing over me. \"[From.GetSheHeCap] wants to see me!\" I laugh, and the servant smiles.",
  "While awaiting news from [From.GetFirstName], I have tried occupying myself... I briefly entertained the idea of courting a visiting diplomat, but I quickly realized it was only because [From.GetHerHis] hair was the exact same shade of color as that of [From.GetFirstName]'s... It seems silly now, reading the heartfelt words my [From.GetLordLady] has sent me.",

  "I am as disappointed as you are.",
  "\"Not so fast\", a voice whispers in my ear, as I'm preparing to turn in for the night. I turn around, but something stings my throat. A dagger? \"We WILL duel, dear [Root.GetFirstName], do you understand? Nod if you understand.\" Panic pounding in my chest, I nod, carefully as to not hurt myself further. \"Good\", the [From.GetManWoman] says, and pulls away into the dark.",
  "Is that you, [From.GetFirstName]? Oh, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I don't have a choice...!",

  "I, uhm... I'm here to... Inspect the... Facilities.",
  "You make a hasty run for it, before anyone recognizes you. There will be no duel between you and §Y[combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\\n",
  "Having studied many a tome on the topic, as well as the practical application of it, I am already well-versed in strategic warfare... Perhaps it is time I focused on something else?",

  "I shall spend more time outdoors, hunting!",
  "On second thought, I like my current way of life.",

  "Then again, I like my current way of life.",
  "I have studied my soldiers practicing their swordsmanship, and I am certain that some of them are becoming unsettled by the constant watch of their [Root.GetTitle]...

  "I will loan [From.GetHerHim] some of my best veterans to practice with.",
  "When we started practicing together, I had a hard time imagining displaying the kind of expert confidence that [mentor_target.GetTitledFirstName] exudes on the battlefield. However, bolstered by [mentor_target.GetHerHis] training, I think I have truly found my calling.",
  "The last time we spoke, [mentor_target.GetTitledFirstName] had only praise to offer me. It's an odd feeling that [mentor_target.GetSheHe] is not here to see me now. Letting out a sigh, I clear my mind, focusing on the feeling of my [Root.GetDuelWeapon] in my hand. It's so natural to me now, as if part of my body.",
  "\"Be careful where you point that thing!\" a courtier cried out today, as I was sauntering back from yet another session at the training grounds, idly playing with the sword in my hand.

  "I'll always be grateful for your lessons, [mentor_target.GetFirstName].",
  "Oh, a master, am I? Why, yes, I suppose I am!",
  "It took time, but I suppose all that hard work has paid off...!",

  "There is value in the historical records.",
  "I think I am more of a visual learner.",
  "My commanders have come to request my advice on some exercises they are performing outside the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] walls. \"We could really use that strategic mind of yours, [Root.GetMasterMistress]\", they say.

  "Soon, you are talking and gesturing excitedly, receiving \"Oohs\" and \"Aaahs\" in an even distribution.\\n",
  "The experienced hunters I have spending time with seem quite pleased with my weapons skills, and are wondering what I would like to explore next.

  "Oh, are these sketches of animal footprints? Tell me more!",
  "What about the actual capturing...? Let's talk more about that!",
  "We have been tracking a wild [Root.GetRegionalBigAnimal] for hours, when a growl sounds in the bushes next to us. A thunk, followed by a soft groan, tells me that my arrow has found its target.

  "Several hours has passed, and the discussion has reached an impasse when it comes to the nature of the universe. [From.GetFirstName] and I agree, but now we need to find out how to convince everyone else. [From.GetFirstName] starts aggressively making [From.GetHerHis] arguments. ",
  " I start wondering if we have gotten lost as we walk through the hedge-maze, but [From.GetFirstName] confidently keeps up the pace. Is the hedge-maze really that big, or is [From.GetFirstName] terrified of telling me [From.GetSheHe] does not know the way out?",
  "[From.GetFirstName] picks out one of the prisoners, and starts mercilessly torture the individual, pulling it through the rack. If this keeps up for much longer, I am sure the individual will break in no time. ",

  "[From.GetFirstName] got this.",
  "[From.GetSheHeCap] probably knows the way out.",
  "We should take it slow instead.",
  "We come across the boar we have been looking for, but [From.GetFirstName] does not give the order to engage. I am not sure if [From.GetSheHe] is waiting it out, unsure what to do or is just being a coward.",

  "The game is starting to develop into a bloodbath, as the armies are clashing together. There seems to have been some sort of miscommunication between [From.GetFirstName] and myself, as I have been put in a terrible position where most of my units are getting slaughtered, whereas [From.GetSheHe] is holding [From.GetHerHis] units back.

  "I am having fun as the evening turns to night. [From.GetFirstName] seem to be a pretty content host, occasionally bringing people over to talk to me. Should a host not be a bit more assertive?",
  "Several hours has passed, and the discussion has reached an impasse when it comes to the nature of the universe. [From.GetFirstName] and I agree, but now we need to find out how to convince everyone else. [From.GetFirstName] let the other side speak their mind.",
  "Some minutes pass, and [From.GetFirstName] admits we seem to have gotten lost in the large hedge-maze. [From.GetSheHeCap] asks me for my thoughts, on how we should try to get out of here. ",
  "[From.GetFirstName] picks out one of the prisoners, and puts the individual at a Judas cradle. Every five minutes [From.GetFirstName] lowers the individual a bit further down on the device, making small talk as [From.GetSheHe] proceeds.",
  "I will rush in and take care of it myself!",
  "The offense is the only way to take people like that out.",
  "Fine, I will win this on my own then!",
  "I should try and find some company for the night. ",
  "We need to be assertive, and I will speak my mind.",
  "We should just keep walking, and we will find our way in the end.",
  "Let us just get this over with already, no need to drag it out.",
  "Let us wait it out.",
  "Yes, let us tire them out.",
  "I believe [From.GetSheHe] has a plan, and will hold my position.",
  "I will just try and enjoy the rest of the evening.",
  "Let them show their own incompetence.",
  "Let us try and remember where we came from in the first place.",
  "This is delicate work, after all.",
  "Though the boar fought valiantly, we finally bring the beast down, to loud cheers from all our retainers. It has been a good hunt.",
  "Though we fight valiantly and the beast look weakened, it flees as I am about to land the final strike. Our retainers look for it, but it cannot be found.",
  "Though the two lumbering men fought for their lives, they finally give up and fall to the ground exhausted. I look over at [From.GetFirstName] and cheer.",
  "After a long dance of steel back and forth, I finally have to admit defeat to our two opponents, and so do [From.GetFirstName]. Both teams fought well.",
  "Though it was a long match with casualties on both sides, [From.GetFirstName] and I finally crush our remaining opponents between our two armies. Thankfully, [From.GetFirstName] understood what I wanted us to do. ",
  "Though it was a long match with casualties on both sides, the last of [From.GetFirstName] and my units finally fall to our opponents.",

  "Several hours pass as we keep walking around the hedge-maze, and [From.GetFirstName] is getting increasingly annoyed at the prospect at spending the night here. Finally my retainers decide to come look for us, and help us find the way out again.",
  "I am certain this was a massive success, as most of our specimen stayed intact throughout the tests we did. Not to mention all the fun we had. ",
  "Several of the specimen broke as we conducted our experiments on them, and I find it hard not to consider this whole ordeal a personal failure, and apologize profusely to [From.GetFirstName].",

  "This fight is more than I could have hoped for.",
  "It was a brutal close match. ",
  "Hopefully [From.GetSheHe] had fun.",

  "The beast fell to the ground from all the wounds, and all the retainers let out a loud cheer.",

  "Several hours pass, and there is no sign of the exit. Every crossroad feels like I have seen it before, and it is increasingly looking like we are going to have to spend the night in here. In the end, one of [From.GetFirstName]'s retainers come in and helps us find the way out.",
  "[From.GetFirstName] seems happy about all the torture [From.GetSheHe] has done. I am not entirely sure what to feel, but as long as [From.GetFirstName] considers it a success all is good, right?",

  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] seem somewhat disappointed in how the evening progressed. My plan does not seem to have worked that well after all.",
  "I have still not received any response from [From.GetFirstName] after the banquet. Seems like my plan did not work as I had hoped after all, maybe I need to try again later?",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] thanked me for the experience, but still seem somewhat disappointed and left in a hurry. I guess it was not that fun after all.",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] leaves without a word as soon as we get out of the maze. [From.GetSheHeCap] did not seem too pleased about the whole incident.",

The barbaric sacrifices performed in the name of their gods are a notorious staple of their dogma.\\nAnd yet, in spite of their infamy, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to surprise the world with [From.GetHerHis] unfathomable atrocities. \\nIn [From.GetHerHis] twisted quest for the blessing of [From.GetHerHis] immortal masters, this vile murderer has forged a realm of blood and skulls, slaughtering thousands of innocent and feeding their souls to [From.GetHerHis] monstrous gods.",
  "[From.Religion.GetName] priests are notorious throughout the world for their sanguinary practices. They consider the many sacrifices that they regularly perform as an imperative necessity, a grim responsibility that every pious man must take part in to avoid the terrible wrath of the gods.\\nYet, few can deny that the accomplishments of [From.GetTitledFirstName] in sating the gods' eternal thirst have towered upon those of all of [From.GetHerHis] colleagues.\\nThrough [From.GetHerHis] faith and dedication, [From.GetSheHe] has cleansed the entirety of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in a sea of blood, forging a sacred legacy that will not soon be forgotten.",
  "Gruesome, yet effective.",
  "The priests drag [From.GetTitledFirstName] screaming to the top of the temple and they keep [From.GetHerHim] steady on the altar while I slice [From.GetHerHim] open with a ceremonial dagger. I then tear out [From.GetHerHis] still beating heart to the cheers of the assembled crowd.",
  "It is decided. In a few weeks, a great tournament shall be held to honor the gods. Of the many who will fight, only one will be acclaimed as the chosen of the gods, while the others will be immolated to sate the eternal thirst for blood of our immortal masters and protect the rest of us from their wrath.",
  "Let the preparations begin!",
  "Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\\nYou have been invited formally invited to assist to the next blood games organized by [From.GetTitledFirstName]. As a member of the [Root.Religion.GetName] nobility, you are encouraged to contribute with fighters from your own dungeons and court.\\n\\nDistinct Salutations\\n[From.GetFullName]",
  "How exciting! I will come for sure!",
  "I will be glad to assist in the next §YBlood Games§!, my liege.",
  "The gods are sure to show their appreciation to the patron of the warrior who will emerge victorious in the blood games. I should make sure to pick the best candidate to represent my dynasty in the arena...",
  "Get me the toughest of our prisoners.",
  "My most vicious Commander will do.",
  "Is there nobody that wishes to fight for me?",
  "Any servant will do.",
  "I have been picked to participate to the next Blood Games that are being organized by my jailers to honor the gods. I have no choice in the matter, but the guards assure me that, if I manage to survive, I will earn my freedom.",
  "[my_blood_contender.GetTitledFirstName] will need all the help [my_blood_contender.GetSheHe] can get in order to survive the Blood Games. Perhaps I should try to invest a bit more in [my_blood_contender.GetHerHis] equipment before sending [my_blood_contender.GetHerHim] off to the slaughtering grounds?",
  "I will make a potion to give [my_blood_contender.GetHerHim] strength and courage!",
  "Nothing wrong in poisoning [my_blood_contender.GetHerHis] weapons, surely...",
  "I will give [my_blood_contender.GetHerHim] the best equipment that gold can buy.",
  "[my_blood_contender.GetSheHeCap] will do fine as [my_blood_contender.GetSheHe] is.",
  "With [From.GetTitledFirstName] no longer in my dungeons, I have been left without a fighter to represent my dynasty's faith to the gods in the upcoming blood games. Still, there is a little time left, if I wish to find somebody else to pick up [From.GetHerHis] place.",
  "Herm... You! You there! You will fight for the gods!",
  "Better wait for the next tournament...",
  "With [From.GetTitledFirstName] dead, I have been left without a fighter to represent my dynasty's faith to the gods in the upcoming blood games. Still, there is a little time left, if I wish to find somebody else to pick up [From.GetHerHis] place.",
  "Unfortunately, the gods did not have the patience to wait for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s Blood Games, and decided to instead reap [From.GetHerHis] very soul last night. Without [From.GetHerHis] patronage, it would appear that the entire tournament has been canceled.",
  "Oh, well...",
  "Scores of criminals, slaves and desperate souls have gathered in the arena of [Root.Capital.GetName], hoping to earn the blessing of the gods by becoming the champion of the tournament. I take my place of honor, alongside the rest of the [Root.Religion.GetName] nobility and wait as the priests finish consecrating the ground before the beginning of the games.",
  "Let the blood start flowing!",
  "Scores of criminals, slaves and desperate souls have gathered in the arena of [From.Capital.GetName], hoping to earn the blessing of the gods by becoming the champion of the tournament. I take my place of honor, alongside the rest of the [Root.Religion.GetName] nobility and wait as the priests finish consecrating the ground before the beginning of the games.",
  "The crowd roars in approval as another warrior falls to the ground, defeated. The weakest contenders have been quickly disposed of, leaving space for the more experienced fighters, and blessing the ground of the arena with their blood. Soon, their remains will be burned to honor the gods.",
  "More blood for the gods!",
  "It was a gruesome trial to say the least, but, as I look up from the mangled remains of my last opponent and bask in the cheering of the crowd, my heart is filled with relief. I have emerged victorious from the Blood Games, proving my worth to the murderous gods of [From.Capital.GetName] and earning eternal glory.",
  "I won!",
  "As my opponent pushes me on the ground and stomps on my wrist, a flash of pain courses through my body, making me lose my weapon. The crowd cheers and my opponent leaves. Then, the priests come, dragging me away from the arena and towards the bloodied altar.",
  "No! Noooo!",
  "The Blood Games of [Root.Capital.GetName]",
  "As the dust settles and the crowd cheers dissipate, the priests escort [From.GetTitledFirstName] up to the arena's main balcony in order to congratulate [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] victory. Through [From.GetHerHis] actions, many souls have been delivered to the gods today, and by [From.GetHerHis] victory, [From.GetSheHe] has undoubtedly blessed the name of my dynasty.",
  "As the dust settles and the crowd cheers dissipate, the priests escort [From.GetTitledFirstName] up to the arena's main balcony in order to congratulate [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] victory. Even though [From.GetSheHe] was not my offering, through [From.GetHerHis] actions, many souls have been delivered to the gods today, placating their ire.",
  "I knew [From.GetSheHe] was the chosen one!",
  "I will have to pick a better candidate next time...",
  "As the dust settles and the crowd cheers dissipate, the priests escort [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] up to the arena's main balcony in order to congratulate [FromFrom.GetHerHim] for [FromFrom.GetHerHis] victory. Even though [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was not my offering, through [FromFrom.GetHerHis] actions, many souls have been delivered to the gods today, placating their ire.",
  "Now that I have abandoned the murderous cult of the [From.GetName] followers, I can finally see how horrible the idea of a blood tournament really is, and I have therefore decided to cancel the event immediately.",
  "No more meaningless deaths!",
  "With [From.GetHerHis] recent conversion, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided that the Blood Games are a barbarous and terrible practice and has therefore decided to cancel the tournament [From.GetSheHe] had been organizing.",
  "Blasphemy! The gods will curse [From.GetHerHim]!",
  "Maybe it is for the best...",
  "Victory cannot be achieved without the protection of the gods. If we wish to prevail against our enemies, we must be willing to make the required sacrifices. Once the gods have been appeased, they will unleash their terrible power against our foes.",
  "All of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] will run with blood!",
  "We shall scour every village for our tribute!",
  "[Root.Capital.GetName] shall pay our price.",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] has performed a great sacrifice, slaughtering hundreds of our own people to garner the favor of the gods during this war. With such a large offering, we are sure to prevail against our foes.",
  "To battle!",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] has performed a great sacrifice, slaughtering hundreds of our own people to garner the favor of the gods during this war. [From.GetHerHisCap] fanatic obsession with human sacrifice will doom us all.",
  "Aren't our enemies killing enough people already?",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] has performed a great sacrifice, slaughtering hundreds of our own people to garner the favor of the gods during this war. [From.GetSheHeCap] hopes that the gods will now grant [From.GetHerHis] armies the strength necessary to defeat my warriors.",
  "What if the gods listened to [From.GetHerHim]?",
  "Senseless slaughter, nothing more.",
  "The pillaging and looting undertaken in your name has earned you a reputation as a fearsome Pirate. All along the coasts, mothers tucking their children in for the night warn that unless they behave, the terrible [Root.GetFirstName], scourge of the seas, will come ashore with [Root.GetHerHis] undead warriors and eat them.",
  "Few alive have a more fearsome reputation than you. Where many Pirates merely raid you destroy entire towns and castles, leaving none alive besides one to spread the tale of [Root.GetFirstName] the Ravager.",
  "I cannot stand [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] takes every opportunity to insult and berate me. Clearly, this [From.GetManWoman] wishes to be my enemy.",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] thoroughly hates me by now and likely wishes me dead. The feeling is, of course, mutual.",
  "We shall be enemies to the end!",
  "My work with [From.GetHerHim] is done.",
  "I have decided that it might be profitable to take some time and resources and try to seriously hurt my sworn enemy. \\n[From.GetTitledFirstName] is an unbearable pestilence upon this world, and I will not rest until I will have made [From.GetHerHis] life a living hell.",
  "I will spread false reports to [From.GetHerHis] spies.",
  "I will spread the most vile rumors about [From.GetHerHim]!",
  "[From.GetSheHeCap] shall never know peace for as long as I live!",
  "Better to bide my time for now...",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] has unleashed [From.GetHerHis] spies throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. These thugs have been spreading false news to my own informants, bringing my spy network in disarray. It has become increasingly harder to trust anything these days...",
  "Two can play this game, [From.GetFirstName]!",
  "Troublesome...",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] is at it again, dragging [From.GetHerHis] own name through the mud as long as [From.GetSheHe] is able of besmirching mine in the process. [From.GetSheHeCap] is spreading the most disgusting rumors about me, trying to pit my own subjects against me.",
  "Will [From.GetSheHe] ever stop?",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] is unbearable. [From.GetSheHeCap] wastes no occasion to mock and berate me, insulting my dynasty and my friends without pause. I do not know how much longer I will be able to endure this relentless barrage of abuse.",
  "Just leave me in peace!",
  "Following my actions, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has started spreading false reports of [From.GetHerHis] own. It appears that the efficacy of my own network of informants has been compromised, at least for the time being...",
  "By carving this imposing Irminsul Tree, the fires of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith have been stoked, bringing a bit of life to the spirits of our old and fierce gods. The first offerings are already being presented at the feet of the new sacred monument of [From.GetName].",

  "Shield us from harm!",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] has ordered the construction of a great monument to worship the old gods and garner their favor. This magnificent shrine has been erected in [From.Capital.GetName], where many shamans, fortunetellers and petitioners have already started to gather, hoping to receive a divine vision.",
  "The old gods still protect us!",
  "As my soldiers overrun the province, I receive a report regarding a curious shrine built at the center of [From.GetName]. Apparently, the local tribes have erected it to garner the favor of their gods, and consider it to be a most sacred symbol.",
  "Destroy it!",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] has laid waste of the Great Pillar of [From.GetName]. [From.GetHerHisCap] soldiers have torn down this sacred monument to the old gods. Having proved unable to protect their holy shrine, we have proven ourselves unworthy of the favor of the gods, who have surely turned their backs on us after this ignominious event.",
  "We have been forsaken!",
  "For too long I have allowed this old, blasphemous relic to pollute my lands and cast its grotesque shadow upon the good people of [From.GetName]. The wailing of the few stubborn old believers fill the air as my soldiers tear down the pillar and scatter its remains to the open fields, never to be found ever again.",
  "We can finally rest easy.",
  "It was only a matter of time before the [From.Religion.GetName] followers torn down the old idol of [FromFrom.GetName]. [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s guards have come today, in the early afternoon, announcing that the great pillar was a blasphemous remnant of a dead cult and needed to be removed forever.",
  "No! You cannot do this!",
  "the Gnat",
  "It would not be appropriate to continue celebrations after the death of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The festival has been therefore canceled to allow the [From.GetTitle]'s close ones to properly mourn [From.GetHerHis] loss.",
  "Such a terrible loss...",
  "With a war brewing on the horizon, we must set aside all frivolous activities and prepare for battle. I must therefore regretfully cancel the festival of [Root.Capital.GetName].",
  "We will celebrate our victory later!",
  "With a war brewing on the horizon, we must set aside all frivolous activities and prepare for battle. In light of this troubling new event, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has had to regretfully cancel the festival of [From.Capital.GetName].",
  "A great festival is exactly what the people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] need to strengthen the bonds with their fellow tribesmen. It will also be a great opportunity for the Chieftains to bring offerings to our ancestors, bringing prosperity to our lands.",
  "Let's get started!",
  "Greetings,\\n[Root.GetTitledFirstName]\\nA great festival is being held at [From.Capital.GetName]. You are hereby invited to join us alongside your family to celebrate our fortune and bring our offerings to our great ancestors.\\nSigned,\\n\\n[From.GetFullName]",

  "Maybe some other time...",
  "I will be glad to join you for the §YGreat Festival§!, my liege.",
  "Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]!\\n\\nI have heard news of the great celebration you are preparing for your fellow tribesmen. I wager you'd enjoy the company of a fellow warrior to exchange stories with.\\n\\nSigned, [From.GetFullName]",
  "Of course you are welcome!",
  "Not this time.",
  "The period of festivities is about to start. All sorts of peddlers, bards and fortunetellers are gathering in [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], bringing their tales and offerings. I should make sure to prepare myself before traveling to meet my tribesmen.",
  "The period of festivities is about to start. All sorts of peddlers, bards and fortunetellers are gathering in [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], bringing their tales and offerings. This is surely going to be a great opportunity to meet new people and learn new games.",
  "I think I will go hunting...",
  "I will take time to groom myself.",
  "I will study our old legends.",
  "I will look for our best craftsmen.",
  "I do not need to worry about anything.",
  "This is going to be amazing!",
  "The celebrations have finally begun. [Root.Capital.GetName] is bustling with activity: people from every corner of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have traveled here to pay their respects to me and my ancestors, exchange tales and goods, and have a good time.",
  "Welcome all!",
  "The celebrations have finally begun. [From.Capital.GetName] is bustling with activity: people from every corner of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have traveled here to pay their respects to [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] ancestors, exchange tales and goods, and have a good time.",
  "So many new faces...",
  "A hoarse voice calls for my name from the crowd of peddlers, catching my attention. An old Seer is waiting for me sitting near an old runic stone. He claims that he will read my future for a small price.",
  "An old woman suddenly jumps in my line of sight, giving me a toothless smile and shaking a cup filled with dice. She claims that she can determine what the stars have in store for me, for the right price.",
  "As I am appraising some of the merchandise of the travelers drawn to the festival, I meet the unsettling gaze of a weird boy in tatters. The kid approaches me slowly, ignoring the crowd bustling with activity around him, and whispers that he can read me my future for just a small price.",
  "Here's a few coppers...",
  "I have no time for this nonsense!",
  "The fortuneteller surprises me by predicting that extraordinary opportunities are about to present themselves to me in my near future, and I need only to pay close attention to find my good fortune.",
  "I always knew I was born lucky!",
  "The fortuneteller assures me that a period of good luck is just around the corner, and that I need only look for the right opportunities in order to change my life for the better.",
  "After giving a thorough look to the signs, the fortuneteller warns me that my future looks grim and I should be very careful about my next choices to avoid any calamity befalling upon me and my family.",
  "As I walk around the crowded streets of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], a strange aroma catches my attention, leading me to the obscure stand of an old alchemist. Seeing my curiosity, the man shows me some of his wares and their prodigious effects.",
  "A love potion, uh?",
  "How about a drink for this charm?",
  "I will burn an offering for you, in exchange for this perfume.",
  "Never mind, I am not interested in what you sell.",
  "A strength potion, you say?",
  "I will burn an offering for you, in exchange for this amulet.",
  "I do not need any of this sorcery.",
  "An old merchant has set up a large stand in the middle of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName] this year, selling all sorts of amulets and trinkets to use at the end of the festival as offerings to the gods of our ancestors. I wonder if I should buy something to burn myself...",
  "The most expensive jewels are the least I can offer.",
  "This amulet looks expensive enough...",
  "If I really *have* to buy something...",
  "I have no money to waste.",
  "I stumbled on [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetTitledFirstName] in the main hall with a group of other distinguished guests. I have heard quite a few good things about [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetHerHim] in the past, and I wonder if this festival is the right occasion to earn [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetHerHis] friendship.",
  "Hail, [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetFirstName]! How fare you?",
  "Let me offer you a drink, [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetFirstName]!",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I spent the evening telling old tales of our clans to each other, having a very good time alongside the other guests of [great_tribal_festival_host.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast. I never noticed how likable [From.GetFirstName] was before...",
  "But what does [From.GetSheHe] *really* wants from me?",
  "Let us become friends!",
  "We should do this again, sometimes.",
  "For some reason, [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetFirstName] has entirely rejected my offer of friendship. I think [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetHerHis] paranoid nature might have gotten the best of [tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetHerHim]...",
  "[tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetFirstName] spent a great evening in the long-house, telling old legends and drinking with the other tribesmen. When finally leaving, right before dawn, we swore an oath of friendship.",
  "We should do this more often!",
  "[tribal_festival_potential_friend_1.GetFirstName] and I spent a very pleasant evening in the long-house, telling old legends and drinking with the other tribesmen. We left the hall at dawn, both glad to have had this opportunity to strengthen our relation.",
  "I was busy exchanging tales with some of the other tribesmen, when [From.GetTitledFirstName] approaches me with a smile, offering me a drink, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to make a toast to new friendships.",
  "What?! What's your angle? Is it poisoned?!",
  "Sure, why not?",
  "Seeing [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetTitledFirstName] having such a good time with the other tribesmen, laughing and drinking in the long-house, is an unbearable sight. I wish I could do something to bring [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetHerHis] insufferable merriment to an end.",
  "This requires some planning...",
  "Enough!",
  "Never mind, I will just have to ignore [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetHerHim]...",
  "It looks like [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetFirstName] is smarter than [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetSheHe] looks. [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetSheHeCap] was able to see through my deception and reject my false offer of friendship.",
  "Oh well... I guess that's it for tonight then.",
  "Just as I hoped, I was able to get [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetTitledFirstName] completely drunk and isolate [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetHerHim] from [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetHerHis] friends. Now is the time to reveal my true intentions...",
  "Nobody is looking us...",
  "Shame on you! What sort of [tribal_festival_potential_enemy_1.GetManWoman] are you?",
  "[From.GetTitledFirstName] fooled me! After getting me drunk, [From.GetSheHe] abandoned me in the wilderness, in the dead of night. I am too tired and confused to find my way back to the tribe, and I think I hear something growling nearby...",
  "Who goes there?!",
  "I do not understand. One moment [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I are having fun, drinking and exchanging tales, and the moment after [From.GetSheHe] is insulting me, shaming me for being nothing but a drunken fool in front of everybody.",
  "You have gone too far!",
  "Whu-? I thought we were friends...",
  "We were all happily celebrating our good fortune in [great_tribal_festival_host.GetTitledFirstName]'s long-house, when [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided to ruin the mood of the feast by yelling my name and showering me with insults, clearly trying to upset me.",
  "These are fighting words!",
  "You are a hateful little [From.GetManWoman]!",
  "I have received several complaints from my guests in the last days regarding [warrior_lodge_guest.GetTitledFirstName]. Apparently, [warrior_lodge_guest.GetSheHe] has been going around town, picking fights, bragging about [warrior_lodge_guest.GetHerHis] great feats and shaming my own tribesmen for lacking in strength and courage.",
  "I am sure we can solve this series of misunderstandings...",
  "Well, [warrior_lodge_guest.GetSheHe] is right!",
  "I will talk to [warrior_lodge_guest.GetHerHim].",
  "The priests are preparing a large feast to offer to our ancestors tonight. I have been spying at the servants bringing in the offerings in the great hall for some time. Some of my friends have dared me to see if I can sneak in and out under the priests' noses without being spotted.",
  "I will show you!",
  "No, that would be wrong.",
  "I am only a few step into the main hall when I hear somebody call for me. One of the priests has spotted me! With my face growing red, I manage to run away just in time to avoid being caught. My playmates welcome me with a shower of chuckles.",
  "Oh, shut up!",
  "With just a bit of care, I manage to sneak past the servants and get into the main hall. The weird statues of the ancestors are all assembled near the long table, decorated with trinkets and surrounded by food.",
  "*Mess up the statues' placement*",
  "*Steal the food*",
  "I was surprised to hear that the statues in the temple of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName] have moved to a nefarious position. The priests wander around town informing everyone of the prodigious event for several hour before news comes out that the misplacement was just the result of [From.GetFirstName] sneaking into the temple and rearranging them.",
  "[From.GetFirstName] managed to sneak into the temple and rearrange the positions of the ancestors' statues! Even better, the old priests thought that the statues had moved by themselves and went screaming around town that a terrible calamity was about to strike all of us before they learned the truth and became the laughing stock of town.",
  "That brat!",
  "Ah! Awesome!",
  "[From.GetFirstName] and some of [From.GetHerHis] playmates have stolen the offerings for tonight's feast of the ancestors. The priests were furious to find the little piglets sleeping in the woods near [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], surrounded by the remains of their loot.",
  "[From.GetFirstName] managed to sneak inside the temple and steal some of the offerings for the ancestors. [From.GetSheHeCap] them brought them outside of town and shared them with the rest of us. We spent the rest of the evening laughing at the grown-ups wandering around the tribe, trying to understand what happened to the missing food.",
  "And now we have to pay for more offerings...",
  "Sweet!",
  "A particularly wealthy and obnoxious merchant has been drawn to town due to the great festival, and one of my playmates has challenged me to steal one of his trinkets while he is distracted haggling, to make up for all the times that he mistreated us children in the past.",
  "I will take the biggest jewel from his stand!",
  "No, stealing is wrong.",
  "Just as I stretch my arm to pick the item from the stand, the merchant grabs me by the wrist and pushes me aside, warning me to keep away from his wares. Trying again now that he has been put on alert would just be a waste of time, so I am forced to return to my playmates empty-handed.",
  "It takes just a few moments of distraction for me to snatch one of the merchant's amulets and run away in the crowd before he can even realize that he has been robbed. I return triumphant to my playmates, and we spend the rest of the afternoon looking from a safe distance the old merchant scrambling through his wares, trying to find the missing trinket.",
  "Ah!",
  "Today's festivities were disrupted by the complaints of a foreign merchant. The old man spent most of the afternoon claiming that one of the town's kids had stolen a precious amulet from his stand and would not leave until he received compensation for his losses.",
  "A particularly wealthy and obnoxious merchant has been drawn to town due to the great festival. Whenever he comes to town, he is always mean to me and my playmates, so, this year, we decided to get even with him. [From.GetFirstName] snuck behind his stand while he was distracted and stole one of his most precious trinkets, leaving the old merchant to spend the rest of the day looking for it.",
  "Fine. Take this money and leave.",
  "The festival has attracted many people from all over the realm to [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName]. Unfortunately, many of the new grownups are stuck-up bores with no good manners. I have half a mind to gather a few of my playmates and teach them a lesson...",
  "Who's up for some mudslinging?",
  "Eh, that is just how grownups are...",
  "We have barely started having fun when a some of the tribes' warriors decide to take matters in their own hands and take on us. All my friends immediately desert me, leaving me alone to face the angry tribesmen.",
  "Hemm... sorry?",
  "With just the help of a few other kids and a well-placed tree, we are able to successfully throw the entire party into disarray. People scream and run for cover, yelling our names and throwing back swears at us. When the adults finally organize to get us, we have already dispersed to laugh off the successful mission.",
  "We should do this again next year!",
  "I was just chatting with some of the other tribesmen in the main square of [great_tribal_festival_host.Capital.GetName], when something hit me on the back! Shouts and complaints swiftly follow, turning the entire square into a complete chaos. A few of the kids have climbed on a nearby tree and they have started throwing mud at the rest of us!",
  "Some of the town's kids, led by [From.GetTitledFirstName], have decided to pester their parents and neighbors by throwing mud at them in the middle of the morning fair.",
  "[From.GetFirstName] decided to take me and some of the other kids and get back at some of the stuck-up adults in our town by laying a trap on them during the morning fair, to cover them in mud and slush. And it was an absolute triumph.",
  "Damn those kids!",
  "You are great, [From.GetFirstName]!",
  "All the grownups are busy, and I am bored. As I try to think of something to do, I spot [scoped_running_child_1.GetFirstName] and suddenly remember about that time [scoped_running_child_1.GetSheHe] bragged about being the fastest kid of the whole tribe.",
  "We will see about that!",
  "Actually, maybe I will just have a nap.",

  "Oh, you will see!",

I have barely the time to look around when the beast emerges growling from the foliage, its gray, sparse mane sprinkled with dried up blood, its yellow eyes staring me with soulless hatred.",
  "When the shrieking battle cry of the eagle pierces my eardrums, making me startle, I am halfway through climbing a large rock formation. An imposing shadow sweeps over the uneven surface of the wall, aimed straight in my direction.",
  "It is hard to tell what time is it, with most of the light blocked by the skeletal branches of the dead trees, but it cannot be too far from sunset when a threatening growl breaks the silence around me, announcing the arrival of a large brown bear. The beast tears down the rotten remains of a trunk as it makes its way towards me with bloodshot eyes and drooling jaws.",
  "I am following the last set of tracks through a patch of tall grass, when a sudden rustle makes me suddenly stop. I cautiously glance on my left side, and immediately spot the fiery golden eyes of the lion. The beast, crouched on the ground with its jaws half-open, looks ready to pounce.",
  "I have slain far bigger game than you!",
  "You will die by my hand, fiend!",
  "No! I must save myself!",
  "Take [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName], but let me live!",

  "I know exactly how to deal with it.",
  "Now we can corner and gut this monster for good.",
  "Finally! Death to the vile monster!",
  "I am not sure about this anymore...",
  "The great wolf fights to the very end, but we are soon able to corner it and pierce through its hide a few times. Keeping the creature at bay with our spears, and patiently wait for the bleeding to weaken it enough to strike again. I land the final blow through the wolf's skull, pushing the creature on the ground, finally vanquished.",
  "I manage to wound one of the eagle's wings as it takes off, leaving the beast unable to flee. The eagle screeches and leaps furiously towards me, its talons grasping for my eyes, but I am able to push it away while taking only a few scratches. As the bird clumsily tries to take flight, I throw my spear through its chest, bringing it down for good.",
  "When I charge the first strike, the bear's response is sluggish, but, the more I poke at it, the angrier the beast gets. Its hide is thick, so much so that I can barely pierce through it. Yet, I do not discourage myself, maintaining enough distance from my foe to avoid its attacks, hitting it repeatedly until it finally falls dead.",
  "I barely escape the lion's pounce. Just as I slide past the jumping beast, I push my spear through its chest, getting pulled alongside it. The monster roars and claws at me, trying to get rid of the weapon, yet I keep a strong hold on it, pushing it further into the lion's flesh while avoiding its attacks, until the creature finally lays dead beneath me.",
  "I will make a trophy out of it.",
  "We will burn its remains.",
  "The sacred ritual of flaying must be performed.",
  "I will bring the carcass back to my fellow warriors.",
  "I think I hear something from the beast's nest...",

  "The fight to slay the great eagle will be remembered by our fellow warriors for generations to come. The creature nearly dragged me to a terrible death during its last assault, but, in the end, we were able to slay it, leaving it to fall screeching from the hill, its wings bloody and broken.",
  "The fight to slay the great bear will be remembered by our fellow warriors for generations to come. The creature nearly crushed me under its massive weight, tearing down several trees in its frenzied drive to kill us, but, in the end, the bear's fury only quickened its bleeding, sealing its death.",
  "The fight to slay the great lion will be remembered by our fellow warriors for generations to come. The creature nearly skewered me on multiple occasions during its desperate struggle, yet I was able to ignore the pain and focus on my assault, and finally manage to plunge my spear through its eye and put an end to its wicked existence.",
  "Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The wolf grabs my arm within its jaws and drags me on the ground, shaking its head violently. I scream and punch the creature with my free arm, until it finally releases me. When I finally retake my senses and push myself up, soaked in my own blood, there is no trace of the wolf left.",
  "Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The eagle's talons grab hold of my clothes, pulling me away from the cliff. I struggle and try to hit the beast, loosening its hold, but not before dooming myself to a harsh fall. When I finally awake, the great eagle is long gone.",
  "Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The bear tramples me in its charge, slamming me against one of the dead trees. I scramble for my spear, and manage to throw it at the beast's head, causing it to falter for a moment. The bear roars and runs away, disappearing in the forest. Unfortunately, the beast's attack was devastating, to the point of making me unable to continue my pursuit.",
  "Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The lion pounces me, crushing me under its massive weight, its terrible jaws snapping at my throat. By plunging my spear underneath its leg, I am able to stop the beast's assault and slip away. My counterattack was enough to make the lion retreat back in the tall grass. Sadly, my wounds prevent me from pursuing my quarry any further.",
  "We were so close...",
  "Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The wolf grabs my arm within its jaws and drags me on the ground, shaking its head violently. I scream and punch the creature with my free arm, but the wolf is relentless and, after momentarily losing its hold, it snaps its jaws on my throat.",
  "Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The eagle's talons grab hold of my clothes, pulling me away from the cliff. I struggle and try to hit the beast, loosening its hold, but not before dooming myself to a deadly fall.",
  "Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The bear tramples me in its charge, crushing me under its massive weight and leaving me a broken smudge in the middle of the dead forest.",
  "Everything happens so fast I can barely react. The lion pounces me with unfathomable speed, slamming me on the ground and quickly closing its jaws around my neck. The creature's teeth swiftly crush my windpipe, leaving me to drown in my own blood.",
  "Ghhhh...",
  "Just as the wolf is about to strike, I swiftly push [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName] directly into the beast's jaws, quickly turning around and running for my life as my companion is horribly mangled by the monstrous creature. My fellow warriors might think me a coward for leaving [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim] to die only to save myself, but I will at least be a living coward.",
  "I duck as the eagle passes over me, and let myself fall on [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName]. My companion's body dampens my fall enough to make me stand up immediately after reaching the ground and run away as fast as my legs can take me, leaving behind myself both the terrible monster and [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetFirstName], cursing me for my cowardice as the beast already circles over [scoped_WL_co_hunter.GetHerHim].",

  "The line of this monster must be extinguished.",
  "Several months have passed since I took the great eagle's nestling after killing its terrible mother. The chick has grown strong and tame under my watch. Unlike its parent, it will spend its life serving men rather than hunting us down.",
  "After years of loyal service and countless hunts, my eagle has finally taken to its last flight to join its ancestors in the Eternal Blue Sky.",
  "All my court will be present at the funeral.",
  "I will miss that eagle.",
  "I will hunt the beast down by myself!",
  "New warriors will soon start flocking to your banners.",
  "A couple of fellow warriors help me constrain the majestic offerings that I have personally picked from my livestock for this occasion. While a a priest chants, I plunge the sacrificial dagger deep into the flesh of the first horse, letting its blood shower over my face. I turn around and the priests inscribe a few holy symbols on my face with blood and dirt.",

  "If I were proud, would I submit myself to your judgment?",
  "Humility is relative to one's state.",
  "I submit to your judgment, wise ones.",
  "How can I possibly prove that?",
  "Of course! I am the most humble [Root.GetTitle] ever!",
  "Despite my many attempts to convince them otherwise, the Brahmins are not satisfied by my display of humility. They claim that my demeanor betrays the inner smugness of somebody born within the highest echelons of nobility, somebody that has no knowledge nor memory of hunger and anonymity.\\nA few of them are convinced that my very desire to be recognized as the heir to Ashoka is proof enough of my unbridled pride.",
  "I understand your concerns, but let us discuss the matter further.",
  "Is your test not faulty to begin with then?",
  "Could we better determine the requirements of your test?",
  "I can only hope you to reconsider your judgment.",
  "But I am humble! Are you blind?!",
  "Enough. I cannot possibly prove this.",
  "According to legend, Siddhartha Gautama was the first to predict the coming of Ashoka. The Gift of Dust, the story holding his prophecy, tells of a time when Ashoka, born as Jaya in one of his previous lives, saw Buddha wandering the streets of his village while playing in the mud. The child, taken by his desire to offer something to the wanderer, threw a fistful of dirt in the Tathagata's bowl.\\nBuddha, moved by his gesture, predicted that Jaya would be reborn as Ashoka, Emperor of all India.\\nThe Brahmins state that, in order to be acknowledged as Ashoka's new form, I will need to prove that I am just as charitable.",
  "Behold, wise ones, the girth of my munificence!",
  "Oh, yes, I understand what you mean, wise ones...",
  "But how should be valued a gift requested?",
  "Let the gold start flowing!",
  "I suppose I could make a show of charity...",
  "I imagine a second fistful of dust will not be enough?",
  "The Brahmins are not satisfied with my show of charity.\\nThey claim that merely giving some gold to the less fortunate is not enough to prove the true purity of intent that Jaya showed when he met Buddha. When Ashoka's past form had almost nothing, he was still driven to share what little he had to a complete stranger.\\nThey say that my display is vacuous at best in comparison as the gifts that I am giving to my subjects I will take back in time as their [Root.GetTitle].",
  "I shall give more than they could ever repay me!",
  "Perhaps it is you who require some of my charity?",
  "How can I fill the hole in this bowl, wise ones?",
  "Wait, I can give more!",
  "I have to care for the realm's stability as well.",
  "Still not enough to compare to a bowl of dirt?!",
  "Enough. I have spent too much already.",
  "It was not an easy task to convince the Brahmins, but their final response was inevitable.\\nIt was only a matter of time before my true nature was revealed for all the world to admire. \\nI am the last incarnation of Ashoka, the great unifier of India.\\nBy returning in the form of [Root.GetFullName] I have led the people of this great land to peace and prosperity just as I did in my past life, and just like my successors will do after I leave this body.",

My [GetFromRelation] invites me to resume our training, but I simply shake my head. [From.GetHerHisCap] attempt to turn me into a better fighter by an intensive training was not as fruitful as either of us hoped.",
  "I angrily crumple another paper and throw it away from me, trying to avoid [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s gaze.

  "My efforts to improve [From.GetFirstName]'s skills seems to have come at the unexpected price of my [GetFromRelation]'s looks. While less enlightened members of the court might berate [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] lack of care, I cannot deny the sight of [From.GetHerHis] oily, tangled hair and furrowed brow has a familiar, scruffy charm to it.",
  "You don't really smell that bad at all!",
  "Ever since I had to abandon some of my more frivolous habits in order to focus on my responsibilities as [Root.GetTitle], I have noticed that several courtiers have begun to avoid me.

A more frivolous person than I might judge [From.GetHerHim] for [From.GetHerHis] recent changes, but I understand all too well the burdens of duty.",
  "Still chewing on a tart, [From.GetFirstName] complains about how most people at court simply do not understand the costs of commitment to one's duty.

  "You have nothing to be ashamed of!",
  "Noting my sour expression as the weaver tightens the string around my gut in order to measure my size for a new clothes I have ordered, [scoped_kindred.GetFirstName] hastily assures me that it is perfectly understandable, and laudable even, for a [Root.GetTitle] to focus on [Root.GetHerHis] duties to the realm, even when it comes at the expense of private concerns.",
